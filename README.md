# Basic Calculator 

A simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” based on user input.

##  Project Objective

Practice creating Python programs to:
- Perform arithmetic operations
- Work with variables and data types
- Accept user input and output results
- Gain familiarity with basic control flow

##  How It Works

1. The program asks the user to:
   - Enter the first number
   - Choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`
   - Enter the second number

2. It then calculates and prints the result.

3. Includes basic error handling for invalid operations and division by zero.

## ðŸ’» Sample Output

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +  
Enter the second number: 5  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
